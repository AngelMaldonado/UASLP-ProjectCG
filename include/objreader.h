/**
 * OBJFileReader class: this class allows the user to read a *.obj file and store the information from that file
 * to different data structures.
 * First, it is required to define a vector<Mesh> to be able to start reading the file, since Mesh class has as
 * attributes a list<Face> (list of faces) and a vector<Vertex> (vector of vertices), and the readFile() method
 * makes all the work to read each line of the .obj file and recognize the characters that identifies the objects (o),
 * vertices (v), and faces (f).
